# LeNet_MNIST-Pytorch
This is a handwritten numeral recognition model trained on MNIST using LeNet.  
The highest accuracy of this model is 100%.  
I didn't validate the saved model on a large amount of data, because this project was only created for learning Deep Learning.  
If necessary, you can download the saved model for verification or relevant code for learning.  
All comments in the code are expressed in Chinese.
